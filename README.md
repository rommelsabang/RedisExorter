This is the program designed to export data from the config.xml into
redis keys. A container is created in docker which creates a redis image.
Maven was used, to import the jedis libraries, with the use of jedis
I am able to set keys and values into redis. A short example of test
cases is shown in the files as well.

The program ran, however I ran into issues late, and ran out of time
to debug and fix those issues.
